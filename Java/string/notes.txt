Strings is a datatype in Java, which is not a primitive type.
Its actually a class, but is easier to use than other classes.

A String is a sequence of characters.

Strings in java are immutable


The code we used to append strings was inefficient.
append values is very inefficient. 
A better way of doing this is called a StringButter.
