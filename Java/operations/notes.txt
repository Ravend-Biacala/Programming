An operand is a term used to describe any object that is manipulated by an operator

everything same as any other language

modulus operator is important
(4 % 3 ) == 1

this gets the remainder after the division

abbreviating operators

result++
result--

result += 2

Conditional statements

        if (isAlien == false)
            System.out.println("it is not an Alien");


Watch out for putting a semicolon after an if statement cuz is closes our that code and won't follow thorugh on whats underneath

if we don't use a code block, only allows on line of statement to execute

So just always use a code block

Logicical operators

>=
=
>
<=
!=

&&           // stands for and, the logical and operator
||           // stands of or // thats two amperstands

bitwise operators? & // we don't usually use.


operator precedence

summary of operators


instance of operator ???



statements cannot be called inside a code block
but vabriables can be accessed inside the code block.

// if statements
if (condition) {
    // insert code
} else if {
    // insert code
} else {
    // insert code
}
