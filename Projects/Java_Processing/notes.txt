==================

mouseX and mouseY are what is called ‘built in variables’. We’ll deal more with
variables in Unit 2. Other built in variables include width and height

===========


frameRate() adjust the
speed the circles appear

noStroke() gets rid of the
circle’s outside

background(188, 209, 40);
in void draw this sets the background colour

rectMode(CENTER) makes
rectangles behave as ellipses do

strokeWeight() thickness of the
stroke (object outline)

stroke() colour of the stroke/outline


mousePressed

keyCode == up


pg 295 

void setup() {
 size(700, 100);
 stroke(255, 102);
}
void draw() {
 background(0);
 for (int i = 0; i < width; i += 6) {
 float r = random(-10, 10);
 strokeWeight(abs(r));
 line(i-r, 100, i+r, 0);
 }
}
